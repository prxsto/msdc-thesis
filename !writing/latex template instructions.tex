\chapter{A Brief \\ Description of \protect\TeX}
 
The \TeX\ formatting program is the creation of
Donald Knuth of Stanford University.
It has been implemented on nearly every general purpose computer and
produces exactly the same copy on all machines.
 
\section{What is it; why is it spelled that way; 
and what do
really long section titles look like in the text and in the
Table of Contents?}
 
\TeX\ is a formatter.  A document's format is controlled
by commands embedded in the text.  
\LaTeX\ is a special version of \TeX---preloaded
with a voluminous set of macros that simplify most
formatting tasks.
 
\TeX\ uses {\it control sequences} to control
the formatting of a document.  These control sequences are usually
words or groups of letters prefaced with the backslash character
({\tt\char'134}).
For example,
Figure \ref{start-2} shows the text that printed the beginning
of this chapter.  Note the control sequence \verb"\chapter" that
instructed \TeX\ to start a new chapter, print the title, and
make an entry in the table of contents.  It is an example
of a macro defined by the \LaTeX\ macro package.
The control sequence \verb"\TeX", which prints the word \TeX,
is a standard macro from the {\it\TeX book}.
The short control sequence \verb"\\" in the title instructed \TeX\ to
break the title line at that point.
This capability is an example of an extension to \LaTeX\
provided by the uwthesis document class.

Most of the time \TeX\ is simply building paragraphs from
text in your source files.  No control sequences are involved.
New paragraphs are indicated by a blank line in the
input file.
Hyphenation is performed automatically.
 
\section{\TeX books}
 
The primary reference for \LaTeX\ is Lamport's second edition
of the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}\cite{Lbook}.
It is easily read and should be sufficient for thesis formatting.
See also the \textsl{\LaTeX\ Companion}\cite{companion} for descriptions
of many add-on macro packages.

Although unnecessary for thesis writers, the \textsl{\TeX book}
is the primary reference for \TeX sperts worldwide.
 
\section{Mathematics}
 
The thesis class does not expand on \TeX's
or \LaTeX's
comprehensive treatment of mathematical equation printing.%
\label{c2note}\footnote{%
% a long footnote indeed.
 Although many \TeX-formatted documents contain no
 mathematics except the page numbers, it seems appropriate
 that this paper, which is in some sense about \TeX,
 ought to demonstrate an equation or two.  Here then, is a statement 
 of the {\it Nonsense Theorem}.
 
 \smallskip
 \def\RR{{\cal R\kern-.15em R}}
 {\narrower\hangindent\parindent Assume a universe $E$ and a symmetric function
  $\$$ defined on $E$, such that for each $\$^{yy}$ there exists a
  $\$^{\overline{yy}}$, where $\$^{yy} = \$^{\overline{yy}}$.
  For each element $i$ of $E$ define
  ${\cal S}(i)=\sum_i \$^{yy}+\$^{\overline{yy}}+0$.
  Then if $\RR$ is that subset of $E$ where $1+1=3$,
  for each $i$
  $$\lim_{\$\to\infty}\int {\cal S}di =
      \cases{0,&if $i\not\in\RR$;\cr
             \infty,&if $i\in\RR$.\cr}$$
  \par}} % end of the footnote
%
The {\it\TeX book}\cite{book}, {\it \LaTeX\ User's Guide}\cite{Lbook},
and {\it The \LaTeX\ Companion}\cite{companion}
thoroughly cover this topic.
 
% ========== Chapter 3
 
\chapter{The Thesis Unformatted}
 
This chapter describes the uwthesis class (\texttt{uwthesis.cls},
version dated 2014/11/13)
in detail 
and shows how it was used to format the thesis.
A working knowledge of Lamport's \LaTeX\ manual\cite{Lbook} is assumed.
 
\section{The Control File}
 
The source to this sample thesis is a single file
only because ease of distribution was a concern.
You should not do this.  Your task will be much easier if you
break your thesis into several files:  a file for the preliminary pages,
a file for each chapter,  one for the glossary, and one for each
appendix.  Then use a control file to tie them all together.
This way you can edit and format parts of your thesis much more
efficiently.
 
Figure~\ref{control-file} shows a control file that
might have produced this thesis.
It sets the document style, with options and parameters,
and formats the various parts of the thesis---%
but contains no text of its own.

   thesis.  It contains no text, only commands which
   direct the formatting of the thesis.
   }
  \label{control-file}
 \end{fullpage}
\end{figure}
 
The first section, from the \verb"\documentclass" to
the \verb"\begin{document}", defines the document class and options.
This sample thesis specifies the \texttt{proquest} style, which is now
required by the Graduate School and is the default.  
Two other, now dated, other styles are available:  \verb"twoside", which is similar but 
produces a wider binding margin and is more suitable for paper printing; and
\verb"oneside", which is really old fashoned.
This sample also specified a font size
of 11 points. 
Possible font size options are: \verb"10pt", \verb"11pt", and \verb"12pt".
Default is 12 points, which is the preference
of the Graduate School. If you choose a smaller size be sure to
check with the Graduate School for acceptability.  The smaller fonts
can produce very small sub and superscripts.

Include most additional formatting packages with \verb"\usepackage",
as describe by Lamport\cite{Lbook}.  The one exception to this
rule is the \verb"natbib" package.  Include it with the \verb"natbib"
document option.
 
Use the \verb"\includeonly" command to format only a part of your
thesis.  See Lamport\cite[sec. 4.4]{Lbook} for usage and limitations.

 
\section{The Text Pages}
 
A chapter is a major division of the thesis.  Each chapter begins
on a new page and has a Table of Contents entry.
 
\subsection{Chapters, Sections, Subsections, and Appendices}
 
 
Within the chapter title use a \verb"\\" control sequence to separate lines
in the printed title (recall Figure \ref{start-2}.).
The \verb"\\" does not affect the Table of Contents entry.
 
Format appendices just like chapters.
The control sequence \verb"\appendix" instructs \LaTeX\ to
begin using the term `Appendix' rather than `Chapter'.
 
 
Specify sections and subsections of a chapter 
with  \verb"\section" and \verb"\subsection", respectively.
In this thesis chapter and section
titles are written to the table of contents.
Consult Lamport\cite[pg. 176]{Lbook} to see which
subdivisions of the thesis can be written to the table of contents.
The \verb"\\" control sequence is not permitted in section and
subsection titles.
 
 
\subsection{Footnotes}
 
\label{footnotes}
 Footnotes format as described in the \LaTeX\ book.  You can also
 ask for end-of-chapter or end-of-thesis notes.
 The thesis class will automatically set these up if
 you ask for the document class option \texttt{chapternotes}
 or \texttt{endnotes}.  
 
If selected, chapternotes will print automatically.  If you choose
endnotes however you must explicitly indicate when to print the notes 
with the command \verb"\printendnotes".  See the style guide for
suitable endnote placement.  

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
Standard \LaTeX\ figures and tables, see Lamport\cite[sec.~C.9]{Lbook},
normally provide the most convenient means to position the figure.
Full page floats and facing captions are exceptions to this rule.

If you want a figure or table to occupy a full page enclose the
contents in a \texttt{fullpage} environment.  
See figure~\ref{facing-caption}.

\subsubsection{Facing pages}
Facing page captions are an artifact of traditional, dead-tree printing,
where a left-side (even) page faces a right-side (odd) page.

In the \texttt{twoside} style, a facing caption
is full page caption for a full page figure or table
and should face the illustration to which it refers.
You must explicitly format both pages. 
The caption part appears on an even page
(left side) and the figure or table
comes on the following odd page (right side).
Enclose the float contents for the caption 
in a \texttt{leftfullpage} environment,
and enclose the float contents for the figure or table 
in a \texttt{fullpage} environment.
The first page (left side) contains the caption. The second page
(right side) could be left blank.  A picture or graph might be pasted onto
this space. See figure~\ref{facing-caption}.


\begin{figure}[t]
\uwsinglespace
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{figure}[p]% the left side caption
       \begin{leftfullpage}
         \caption{ . . . }
       \end{leftfullpage}
     \end{figure}
     \begin{figure}[p]% the right side space
       \begin{fullpage}
          . . .
          ( note.. no caption here )
       \end{fullpage}
     \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\caption[Generating a facing caption page]{This text would create a
  double page figure in the two-side styles. }
\label{facing-caption}
\end{figure}
 
You can use these commands with the \texttt{proquest} style, but they have little
effect on online viewing.
 
 
\subsection{Horizontal Figures and Tables}
Figures and tables may be formatted horizontally
(a.k.a.\ landscape) as long as their captions appear
horizontal also.  \LaTeX\ will format landscape material for you.

Include the \texttt{rotating} package 
\begin{demo}
\\usepackage[figuresright]\{rotating\}
\end{demo}
and read the documentation that comes with the package. 

Figure~\ref{sideways} is an example of how a landscape
table might be formatted. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\uwsinglespace
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{sidewaystable}
         ...
         \caption{ . . . }
     \end{sidewaystable}
\end{verbatim}
\caption[Generating a landscape table]{This text would create a
  landscape table with caption.}
\label{sideways}
\end{figure}
 


\subsection{Figure and Table Captions}
Most captions are formatted with the \verb"\caption" macro as described 
by Lamport\cite[sec. C.9]{Lbook}. 
The uwthesis class extends this macro to allow
continued figures and tables, and to provide multiple figures and
tables with the same number, e.g., 3.1a, 3.1b, etc.
 
To format the caption for the first part of
a figure or table that cannot fit
onto a single page use the standard form:
\begin{demo}
\\caption[\textit{toc}]\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
To format the caption for the subsequent parts of 
the figure or table 
use this caption:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(-)\{(continued)\}
\end{demo}
It will keep the same number and the text of the caption will be 
{\em(continued)}.

To format the caption for the first part of
a multi-part figure or table
use the format:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(a)[\textit{toc}]\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
The figure or table will be lettered (with `a') as well as numbered.
To format the caption for the subsequent parts of 
the multi-part figure or table
use the format:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(\textit{x})\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
where {\em x} is {\tt b}, {\tt c}, \ldots.
The parts will be lettered (with `b', `c', \ldots).

If you want a normal caption, but don't want a ToC entry:
\begin{demo}
\\caption()\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
Note that the caption number will increment.  You would normally use this 
only to leave an entire chapter's captions off the ToC.


\subsection{Line spacing}

Normally line spacing will come out like it should. However, the 
ProQuest style allows single spacing in certain situations:
figure content, some lists, and etc.
Use \verb"\uwsinglespace" to switch to single spacing within
a \verb"\begin{}" and \verb"\end{}" block.
The code examples in this document does this. 

\section{The Preliminary Pages}
 
These are easy to format only because they are relatively invariant
among theses.  Therefore the difficulties have already been encountered
and overcome by \LaTeX\ and the thesis document classes.

Start with the definitions that describe your thesis.
This sample thesis was printed with the parameters:

\begin{demo}
\\Title\{The Suitability of the \\LaTeX\\ Text Formatter\\\\
   for Thesis Preparation by Technical and\\\\
   Non-technical Degree Candidates\}
\\Author\{Jim Fox\}
\\Program\{IT Infrastructure\}
\\Year\{2012\}

\\Chair\{Name of Chairperson\}\{title\}\{Chair's department\}
\\Signature\{First committee member\}
\\Signature\{Next committee member\}
\\Signature\{etc\}

\end{demo}
 
Use two or more \verb"\Chair" lines if you have co-chairs.
 
\subsection{Copyright page}
Print the copyright page with \verb"\copyrightpage".

\subsection{Title page}
Print the title page with \verb"\titlepage".
The title page of this thesis was printed with%
 
\begin{demo}
\\titlepage
\end{demo}
 
You may change default text on the title page with these
macros.  You will have to redefine \verb"\Degreetext", for instance,
if you're writing a Master's thesis instead of a dissertation.\footnote{If you use these they can
be included with the other information before \\copyrightpage".}

\begin{list}{}{\itemindent\parindent\itemsep0pt
   \def\makelabel#1{\texttt{\char`\\#1}\hfill}\uwsinglespace}
\item[Degree\char`\{{\it degree name}\char`\}]
   defaults to ``Doctor of Philosophy''
\item[School\char`\{{\it school name}\char`\}] defaults to
``University of Washington''
\item[Degreetext\char`\{{\it degree text}\char`\}] defaults to
``A dissertation submitted \ldots''
\item[textofCommittee\char`\{{\it committee label}\char`\}] defaults to
``Reading Committee:''
\item[textofChair\char`\{{\it chair label}\char`\}] defaults to
``Chair of the Supervisory Committee:''
\end{list}

These definitions must appear \underline{before} the \verb"\titlepage" command.

 
\subsection{Abstract}
Print the
abstract with \verb"\abstract".
It has one argument, which is the text of the abstract.
All the names have already been defined.
The abstract of this thesis was printed with
 
\begin{demo}
\\abstract\{This sample . . . `real' dissertation.\}
\end{demo}
 
 
\subsection{Tables of contents}
Use the standard \LaTeX\ commands to format these items.
 
 
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
Use the \verb"\acknowledgments" macro to format the acknowledgments page.
It has one argument, which is the text of the acknowledgment.
The acknowledgments of this thesis was printed with
 
\begin{demo}
\\acknowledgments\{The author wishes . . . \{\\it il miglior fabbro\}.\\par\}\}
\end{demo}
 
 
\subsection{Dedication}
Use the \verb"\dedication" macro to format the dedication page.
It has one argument, which is the text of the dedication.
 
\subsection{Vita}
Use the \verb"\vita" macro to format the curriculum vitae.
It has one argument, which chronicles your life's accomplishments.

Note that the Vita is not really a preliminary page.
It appears at the end of your thesis, just after the appendices.
 
 
%%  
%% \section{Customization of the Macros}
%%  
%% Simple customization, including 
%% alteration of default parameters,  changes to dimensions,
%% paragraph indentation, and margins, are not too difficult.
%% You have the choice of modifying the class file ({\tt uwthesis.cls})

\chapter{Running \LaTeX\\
  ({\it and printing if you must})}
 
 
From a given source \TeX\ will produce exactly the same document
on all computers and, if needed, on all printers.  {\it Exactly the same}
means that the various spacings, line and page breaks, and
even hyphenations will occur at the same places.

How you edit your text files and run \LaTeX\ varies
from system to system and depends on your personal preference.

\section{Running}

The author is woefully out of his depth where 
\TeX\ on Windows is concerned.  Google would be his resource.
On a linux system he types

\begin{demo}
\$\ pdflatex uwthesis
\end{demo}

and it generally works.

 
\section{Printing}
 
All implementations of \TeX\ provide the option of {\bf pdf} output,
which is all the Graduate School requires.  Even if you intend to
print a copy of your thesis create a 
{\tt pdf}.  It will print most anywhere.
