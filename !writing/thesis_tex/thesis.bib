  abstract = {National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.},

  abstract = {The efficient and accurate prediction of building energy consumption can improve the management of power systems. In this paper, the rough set theory was used to reduce the redundant influencing factors of building energy consumption and find the critical factors of building energy consumption. These key factors were then used as the input of a deep neural network with a “deep” architecture and powerful capabilities in extracting features. Building energy consumption is output of the deep neural network. This study collected data from 100 civil public buildings for rough set reduction, and then collected data from a laboratory building of a university in Dalian for nearly a year to train and test deep neural networks. The test included both the short-term and medium-term predictions of building energy consumption. The prediction results of the deep neural network were compared with that of the back propagation neural network, Elman neural network and fuzzy neural network. The results show that the integrated rough set and deep neural network was the most accurate. The method proposed in this study could provide a practical and accurate solution for building energy consumption prediction.},

The root of this problem is, and has always been, the Federal government’s abdication of its responsibility to provide housing for low-income renters, and the subsequent failure of the City and State to view the need as a housing crisis and not a homelessness crisis. This mindset has fueled decades of shortsighted policies and a reflexive retreat into simplistic, often ideological attempts to manage the problem, rather than solve it. The cost of this failure has been massive in both its human and monetary quotients.},

  abstract = {Building energy consumption prediction plays an irreplaceable role in energy planning, management, and conservation. Data-driven approaches, such as artificial neural networks, support vector regression, gradient boosting regression and extreme learning machine are the most advanced methods for building energy prediction. However, owing to the high nonlinearity between inputs and outputs of building energy consumption prediction models, the aforementioned approaches require improvement with regard to the prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. To counter these shortcomings, a novel vector field-based support vector regression method is proposed in this paper. Through multi-distortions in the sample data space or high-dimensional feature space mapped by a vector field, the optimal feature space is found, in which the high nonlinearity between inputs and outputs is approximated by linearity. Hence, the proposed method ensures a high accuracy, a generalization ability, and robustness for building energy consumption prediction. A large office building in a coastal town of China is used for a case study, and its summer hourly cooling load data are used as energy consumption data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance than commonly used methods with regard to the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability.},
